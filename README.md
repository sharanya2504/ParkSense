ParkSense: Smart Parking Violation Detection using Rover

ParkSense is an AI-powered real-time parking monitoring system designed for smart campus environments, equipped with cameras and sensors to autonomously scan parking lots and detect parking violationsâ€”such as students parking in reserved faculty spots.

Key Features:
->Real-time number plate detection using YOLO object detection

->OCR-based license plate text extraction

->Student vs Faculty slot validation using a custom rule engine

->Jetson Nano-based edge computing for fast, local inference

Technologies Used:
->YOLOv8 for object detection

Paddle OCR

Python + OpenCV

Jetson Nano for onboard computation

Linux-based rover for test deployment

Use Case:
Originally developed for a college parking system, ParkSense ensures efficient and fair parking by detecting and notifying administrators of any unauthorized vehicle placements.
